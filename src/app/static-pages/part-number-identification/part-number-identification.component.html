        <h1>Part Number Identification</h1>
        <p>Here's a guide to help you identify part numbers and ensure the accuracy of your orders.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Dell part numbers usually consist of at least 5 alphanumeric characters. This unique identifier aids in ensuring the authenticity and compatibility of the part.</li>
            <p>Example: <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/3rrn8-dell-solid-state-drive.html">3RRN8</a>, <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/463-7704-dell-networking-n2048p-48-port-poe-10-100-1000-layer-2-managed-gigabit-ethernet-switch-rack-mountable-with-2-x-10-gigabit-sfp-ports.html">N2048P</a>,
                and <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/407-bbwl-dell-10gbase-t-copper-30m-rj-45-connector-sfp-transceiver-module.html">407-BBWL</a>
            </p>
            <li>HP part numbers typically contains 6 numeric digits followed by three alphanumeric digits, like so: <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/820178-001-hp-video-card.html">820178-001</a>,
                <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/498152-001-hp-1200-watts-common-slot-hot-swappable-redundant-power-supply.html">498152-001</a>, and <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/823371-l21-hp-intel-processor.html">823371-L21</a>
            </li>
            <p>Suffixes such as N for ROHS Compliant Parts or revisions, and RB for refurbished products, can also appear at the end of part numbers.</p>
            <p>Example: <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/a7214bn-hp-server-hard-drive.html">A7214BN</a> and
                <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/j4135a-rb-hp-jetdirect-1-x-port-rs-232-serial-1-x-slot-localtalk-print-server-internal-card.html">
    J4135A-RB</a></p>
            <li>IBM has a distinct method for identifying and marking parts, making it simpler for technicians, engineers, and customers to make sure they have the correct part for their systems. Their signature style involves a code composed of seven characters,
                where the third character is always an alphabetical letter.</li>
            <p>Some typical examples include: <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/13m7156-ibm-2-00ghz-1mb-l2-cache-socket-940-amd-opteron-246-single-core-1-core-processor.html">13M7156</a>,
                <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/00am111-ibm-amd-processor.html">00AM111</a>, and <a href="https://itechdevices.ae/13n0703-ibm-2-60ghz-1000mhz-fsb-1mb-l2-cache-socket-940-amd-opteron-252-single-core-1-core-processor.html">13N0703</a>.
            </p>
            <li>Toshiba has its own conventions for labeling and identifying components. These unique identifiers are essential for ensuring compatibility and maintaining the efficiency of systems. Most Toshiba parts adhere to a 10-character format, starting
                with a letter. The initiating letter can be one among P, V, F, H, or A.</li>
