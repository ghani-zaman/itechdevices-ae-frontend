        our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our
        third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they
        cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will
        also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to
        protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The categories of

        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong> DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong>In Short: </strong>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your
        information.</p>
        <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
        information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain
        cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong> HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong>In Short: </strong>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
        in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
        personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
        or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
        information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
        and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong> HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
        technical security measures.</p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
        protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts
        to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
        technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
        cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
        improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
        your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own
        risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong> DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></p>

        </p>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you
        represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or</p>
        <p>guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn
        that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate
        the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
        aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
        orders&#64;itechdevices.ae.</p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong> WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong>In Short: </strong>You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
        <p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may
        be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
        consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact
        details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
        <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,
        when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
        <p>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and
        promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send,
        replying "STOP" or "UNSUBSCRIBE" to the SMS messages that we send, or by contacting us using the details
        provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed from
        the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you
        service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond
        to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>Account Information If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or
        terminate your account, you can:</p>
        <p>- Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</p>
        <p>- Contact us using the contact information provided.</p>
        <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from
        our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
        troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with
        applicable legal requirements.</p>
        <p>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you
        can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove
        cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. If you have
        questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at orders&#64;itechdevices.ae.</p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong> CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
        browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
        recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
        browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
        online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
        you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-uppercase"><strong> DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
