      <li><strong>MISCELLANEOUS </strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in
      respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you
      and
      us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall
      not
      operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest
      extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to
      others
      at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or
      failure
      to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a
      provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable,
      that
      provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does
      not
      affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
      venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a
      result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms
      will
      not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and
      all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and
      the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.</p>
